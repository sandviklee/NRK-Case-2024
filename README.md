# NRK Case Assigment
#### Summer interns 2024

This is a repository for the case for summer interns 2024 given by the developer group at NRK. The case is to be presented in the interview.

## The Project

The task was to make an app that shows you the most (and less) popular NRK programs, hence the name Program Pulse. The task has been given with a data set, and the app was recommended to be a web app.

### Data set

The data set consists of four things

-   seriesId
-   date
-   screen
-   views

As the name of the data set says, it should have been viewer numbers NRK TV from 2019, but the data was actually from 2018, so i stuck with that.

## How to open
